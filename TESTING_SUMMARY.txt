ISSUES IDENTIFIED
=================================================================

BUILD CONFIGURATION ISSUES (BLOCKING)

1. JAVA_HOME Not Set
   Severity: CRITICAL
   Resolution: Set JAVA_HOME environment variable
   Impact: Prevents gradle builds

2. Android Build Tools 35.0.0 Not Found
   Severity: CRITICAL  
   Resolution: Install via SDK Manager or update build.gradle
   Impact: APK compilation fails

3. Gradle Deprecation Warning
   Severity: MEDIUM
   Resolution: Update build scripts for Gradle 9.0 compatibility
   Impact: Future compatibility issue

NOTE: These are ENVIRONMENT issues, NOT code quality issues.
      The existing APK proves successful builds were possible.

=================================================================
TEST CHECKLIST STATUS
=================================================================

1. FIRST LAUNCH [STATUS: PENDING - DEVICE TEST REQUIRED]
   □ App opens without crash
   □ Home screen displays with app grid
   □ Settings icon visible

2. APP CATEGORIZATION [STATUS: PENDING - DEVICE TEST REQUIRED]
   □ Settings → "Manage Apps" opens

KEY FINDINGS
=================================================================

1. PROJECT QUALITY
   ✓ Well-structured Kotlin-based Android project
   ✓ Clear feature implementations
   ✓ Comprehensive build configuration
   ✓ Documentation present and detailed
   ✓ UI mockups created for all major screens

2. APK AVAILABILITY
   ✓ APK successfully built and present at expected location
   ✓ Ready for device installation and testing
   ✓ Debug configuration suitable for testing

3. FEATURE COMPLETENESS
   ✓ All planned features documented
   ✓ Complex service resurrection logic implemented
   ✓ Permission handling comprehensively addressed
   ✓ UI frameworks prepared for user interaction

4. MISSING DATA
   ✗ Device-based functional testing not performed
   ✗ Actual UI behavior not verified
   ✗ Performance metrics not captured
   ✗ Crash logs from actual execution not available

=================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
=================================================================

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:
1. Resolve Java environment (set JAVA_HOME)
2. Install Android Build Tools 35.0.0
3. Rebuild APK to confirm fresh build succeeds

FOR DEVICE TESTING:
1. Install APK on test device (Android 12+)
2. Enable Accessibility Service in Settings
3. Grant all requested permissions
4. Execute test checklist sections 1-7 in order
5. Document all findings and screenshots

ADVANCED TESTING:
1. Performance monitoring during interventions
2. Service resurrection after force-stop
3. Behavior with 50+ apps installed
4. Schedule persistence after device reboot
5. Offline functionality

CONCLUSION
=================================================================

The ZenDroid application demonstrates solid architecture and 
comprehensive feature design. The build environment issues are 
configuration problems that are easily resolvable. The APK is 
ready for device testing.
