# Current Project Status

## Status: Sprint 2 Complete ✅
The project has successfully completed Sprint 2. The core "hardening" features are implemented, and the build system is fully restored.

## Achievements
- **Build Restored**: All Gradle build errors resolved (AndroidX, Theme, Dependencies).
- **Hardening Completed**: Intervention flow (Reason, Duration, Friction) is fully implemented.
- **Security**: Added race condition guards to `InterventionManager`.
- **APK Ready**: Debug APK generated and verifiable via IDX Browser Simulator.

## Next Steps
1. Perform manual verification using the **IDX Browser Simulator**.
2. Alternatively, verify locally on your laptop using **Android Studio**.
3. Begin Sprint 3 Planning (Yellow app bottom sheet, UI polish).
